Codalema is one of the experiments devoted to the detection of ultra high energy cosmic rays by the radio method. The main objective is to study the features of the radio signal induced by the development in the atmosphere of extensive air showers (EAS) generated by cosmic rays in the energy range of 10 PeV-1 EeV . After a brief presentation of the detector features, the main results obtained are reported (emission mechanism, lateral distribution of the electric field, energy calibration, etc.). The first studies of the radio wave front curvature are discussed as new preliminary results.

You can find the paper and some matlab/C++ codes in this repository.
